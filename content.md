How C++ fares against Python here?

``` c++
int      x1 = pow(2, 63);  // GCC: overflow
unsigned x2 = pow(2, 63);  // GCC: overflow
uint64_t x3 = 1   << 63;   // GCC: shift count >= type width
*uint64_t x4 = 1ul << 63;
```

# OK.  Letâ€™s order food.

# At a Restaurant

For every item you order, say _the waiter_

- goes to a register

- checks availability

- makes an entry

- requests food preparation

- checks prepared items against register

- delivers to you

> **Terrible. Turnaround. Time**
>
> You get hungry + angry â†’ `hangry` ðŸ˜

# At Home

For every item you order, say _Squiggy_

- goes to a register

- checks availability

- makes an entry

- requests food preparation

- checks prepared items against register

- delivers to you

> You tip the man **delivering 30 mins later**!

# Why?

## Different Settings, Different Requirements

* At a restaurant, you expect a high turn-around time
  - Wasting time on **avoidable**, petty procedures means an overall delay in eating

* When ordering from home, you know itâ€™ll take time
  - Wasting 5 mins is OK when itâ€™s 30 mins b/w restaurant â†” home (bottleneck elsewhere)

## Critical vs Non-critical Software

* .tag[Performance] When the network lag, I/O read latency or user input is the bottleneck, wasting a few milliseconds/operation is OK _e.g. running a VM, garbage collecting, etc._

* .tag[Flexibility] Since performance isnâ€™t epitome, sacrificing finer control for better features is OK too! _e.g. well-polished data structures like in-built dictionaries, big integers, etc._

> Good engineers use the **right tool for the right job**.

# Browser is **system software**

Itâ€™s complex and critical; comparable to a

* Kernel

* Game engine

* Compiler / virtual machine

* Real-time financial trading system

.pull-right[
> Wasting some minuscule time delta every operation = **systemic lag** hurting productivity.
]

.left[## C++]

* .tag[Performance] Gives very minimal abstraction thereby leading to native speeds
* .tag[Flexibility] Projects the underlying machine, doesnâ€™t get in programmerâ€™s way

# Browser Expectations

* No lags
  - Used for almost every task: minor lags â‰… huge productivity loss
  - **Need**: Choosing infra without systemic lags
  - **Need**: Flexibility to have custom memory managers / allocators

* Feature abundance
  - Every user is unique: each wouldâ€™ve have come to expect different things from it
  - **Need**: Different subsystems â€“ made up of even different codebases â€“ interface smoothly
  - **Need**: Access to various hardware-exposed features e.g. [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD), AES instruction set, GPU, etc.

---

# Browser Expectations

* No memory leaks
  - Run the entire day: having leaks would mean hitting memory cap
  - **Need**: Stringent, controlled memory access patterns

* No security holes
  - Itâ€™d mean userâ€™s personal data loss, money loss, etc.
  - **Need**: Access to underlying machineâ€™s security features

## Built-in Data Types / Primitives

.pull-left[
### Integral Types.red[Â¹]

* `char`     (== 1 byte)
* `char16_t` (>= 2 bytes)
* `char32_t` (>= 4 bytes)
* `short`    (>= 2 bytes)
* `int`      (>= short)
* `long`     (>= 4 bytes)
* `long long` (>= 8 bytes)

]

.pull-right[
### Floating-point Types

* `float` (32-bit; IEEE-754 specified single-precision)
* `double` (64-bit; IEEE-754 specified double-precision)
* `long double` (unspecified: can be 80, 96 or 128 bits depending on compiler and machine)

]

### Other Types
- `void`
- `bool` (implementation-defined)
- Pointer types
  * Width: executableâ€™s bit width; check `sizeof(void*)`
  * Arithmetic based on pointed-to type e.g. `int *p; ++p;` moves `p` by `sizeof(int)`
- Array types e.g. `int[2], char[6]`

.footnote[.red[Â¹] : variants of `unsigned` and `signed` â€” usually [twoâ€™s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement)]
