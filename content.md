## Different Settings, Different Requirements

* When such hardware is non-existent, software implementation is provided as a fallback
  - However many languages project nothing more than a simple model of x86; some don‚Äôt even do that!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Python‚Äôs `int` has arbitrary-precision because internally [**all** integers are big ints](https://rushter.com/blog/python-integer-implementation/); software emulation as hardware natively can‚Äôt.
  - Every programmer is penalized for greater flexibility
  - Programmer is never exposed to system‚Äôs native `int`, so that expressions like this work: `2 ** 80 = 1208925819614629174706176`
* C++ doesn‚Äôt provide it since your machine doesn‚Äôt have one!
  - Most machines can natively only do upto 64-bit math since they‚Äôre 64-bit CPUs
  - .tag[Flexibility] Programmer needing _big int_ can always include a library or write a custom implementation e.g. [GNU Multiple Precision](https://gmplib.org/) library is one of the fastest

Simple, _complete_ program: no classes, no libraries.

- **Compile-time**: types, qualifiers, functions, structs, classes, templates, etc. exist.
- **Run-time**: Oodles of relocatable machine code your machine loves to gobble!

While languages compiling to byte code, keep type information at run-time too for _reflection_, _garbage collection_, _optimization_, ‚Ä¶ C++ strips them and spits plain assembly; [most things vanish into 0 s and 1 s](https://godbolt.org/z/YZCG8u).

struct Widget {
  void Scroll(int clicks) { y_ += (clicks * OFFSET); }

private:
  constexpr static int OFFSET = 3;

  float x_, y_;
  int scale_;
};
```

Equivalent to

``` c++
// a simple struct with just data; called POD (plain-old data) at times
struct __Widget {    // object has only the data (member variables)
  float x_, y_;
  int scale_;
};

// code elsewhere (.text segment)
void __Widget_Scroll(__Widget* w, int clicks) {
  w->y_ += (clicks * 3);  // OFFSET resolved at compiled-time
}
```

* Only instance variables make up an object; use `sizeof(Widget)` to check size

# 3.1 Function/method **dispatch**

* Most function calls in C++ are glorified `JMP` instructions (assembly)
* **Static typing**: **at compile-time** we know all types, sizes, functions, parameters,‚Ä¶

* Exact offset where functions code resides in memory is known at compile-time

* The compiler _dispatches_ this function call with the exact `JMP` instruction

* Sometimes exact function is known only at run-time: we need **dynamic dispatch**

* Useful for abstractions; situations where caller doesn‚Äôt know the exact function to run

* **Need**: plug-ins, interfaces, separation of concern, etc. E.g. text editor with plugins
  - Text editor declares (not defines) a `bool post-process(std::string)` function
  - Every plug-in author implements (defines) it differently
  - When compiling editor the actual function‚Äôs code is non-existent; offset unknown
  - At run-time, if a plug-in SO/DLL is present, function is dynamically dispatched
  - **Decouples code**; both editor and plug-in code can build independently

# 3.2 Virtual methods and interfaces

  virutal Size GetResolution() const = 0;
  virtual void PutPixel(float x, float y, Color c) = 0;
};

  Size GetResolution() const override { return my_resolution_; }
