Why go through

How [C++](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/506ad2b09f29373d) fares against Python here?

``` c++
int      x1 = pow(2, 63);  // GCC: overflow
unsigned x2 = pow(2, 63);  // GCC: overflow
uint64_t x3 = 1   << 63;   // GCC: shift count >= type width
*uint64_t x4 = 1ul << 63;
```

**Results with GCC**

# At a Restaurant

For every item you order, _the waiter_

- goes to a register

- makes an entry

- requests food preparation

- checks prepared items against register

- delivers to you

> **Terrible. Turnaround. Time**

> You: hungry + angry = `hangry` ðŸ˜

# At Home

For every item you order, _Squiggy_

- goes to a register

- makes an entry

- requests food preparation

- checks prepared items against register

- delivers to you

> You tip the man for **delivering 30 mins later**!

# What changed?

## Different Settings, Different Expectations

* At a restaurant, you expect a high turn-around time
  - Wasting time on petty procedures is frustrating

* When ordering from home, you know itâ€™ll take time
  - Wasting 5 mins is OK when itâ€™s 30 mins b/w restaurant â†” home (bottleneck elsewhere)

> Browser is **system software**.

Itâ€™s as complex as a

* Kernel

* Game engine

* Compiler / virtual machine

* Real-time financial trading system

# Browser Expectations

* No lags
  - Used for almost every task: minor lags â‰… huge productivity loss
  - **Need**: Choosing infra without systemic lags
  - **Need**: Flexibility to have custom memory managers / allocators

* Feature abundance
  - Every user is unique: each wouldâ€™ve have come to expect different things from it
  - **Need**: Different subsystems â€“ made up of even different codebases â€“ interface smoothly
  - **Need**: Access to various hardware-exposed features e.g. [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD), AES instruction set, GPU, etc.

---

# Browser Expectations

* No memory leaks
  - Run the entire day: having leaks would mean hitting memory cap
  - **Need**: Stringent, controlled memory access patterns

* No security holes
  - Itâ€™d mean userâ€™s personal data loss, money loss, etc.
  - **Need**: Access to underlying machineâ€™s security features
