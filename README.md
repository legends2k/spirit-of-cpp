# The Spirit of C++
A presentation for the non-C++ programmer to build a healthy C++ mental model.  High-level details are emphasized over low-level ones; it takes the approach that when learning something new, having a high-level and simple view leads to a healthy model.

## Overview

> C++11 feels like a new language. — [Bjarne Stroustrup](http://www.stroustrup.com/C++11FAQ.html#think), Creator of C++

C++ has sort of become an expert-friendly language [like its creator acknowledges](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/406923/the-problem-with-programming/).  With C++11, many changes were made to the original standard (C++03) making the language more high-level, safe and convenient.  The last point is essential for beginners who want to learn the language.  With later C++ standards (C++11, C++14, C++17, …) making it more high-level, the preferred method of teaching and, more importantly, using C++ is stay at a high-level and go low later, when there’s a necessity:

> Experienced C++ programmers as well as C++ novices must learn to use Standard C++ as a new and higher-level language as a matter of course and descend to lower levels of abstraction only where absolutely necessary. — [Learning Standard C++ as a New Language](http://www.stroustrup.com/new_learning.pdf), §5 Summary, Bjarne Stroustrup

This presentation tries to use live examples (code with disassembly), data diagrams and lots of code examples to build a healthy C++ mental model.  Lot of details, pointers and recommendations are strewn across the presentation (as links) so that an interested learner can go deep and explore more; the hope is that one would.  The not-so-interested parties can still get a good overview.  When they hit a bottleneck or want to learn _that_ concept they think might be useful in solving their current problem, they’d know where to come and refer.
